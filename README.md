# StdAsyncPool
This simple math program with using std::async threadpool

The math problem is:
Find all natural numbers belonging to the range [1 000 000; 2 000 000] where each number is factored to two factors in all possible ways and the set of difference of factors will contain at least three elements not exceeding 100.
For example: for the number 16 we get the factors 16*1, 8*2, 4*4 and the difference 15, 6, 0
